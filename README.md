# DEEP LEARNING-BASED SCENE CLASSIFICATION OF VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY FOR POST-EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT

## Overview

This repository features a deep learning-based system for classifying scenes in very high-resolution satellite imagery, with a focus on post-earthquake damage assessment. The primary case study involves the devastating earthquakes that occurred in Kahramanmaraş province, Türkiye, in 2023.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Maxar's very high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery.
- Two-stage scene classification:
  - **Classifier #1:** Detects building presence.
  - **Classifier #2:** Categorizes scenes into collapsed and non-collapsed buildings.
- Deep learning models, including ResNet-101 and DenseNet-121, are employed for accurate and efficient classification.
- Results from Antakya and Iskenderun city centers with detailed accuracy metrics.

## Why Use This Repository

- Efficient and automated earthquake damage assessment using satellite imagery.
- Practical approach with scene classification, reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources.
- Valuable insights for humanitarian aid efforts and post-earthquake response planning.
